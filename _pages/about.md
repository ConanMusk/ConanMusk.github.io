<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year master's student at the School of Electronic Science, National University of Defense Technology ([NUDT](http://yjszs.nudt.edu.cn/index/index.view)), under the supervision of [Prof. Jingyuan Xia](https://www.xiajingyuan.com/). Previously, I obtained my B.Eng in Communication Engineering from the School of Communication and Information Engineering at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications([NJUPT](https://scie.njupt.edu.cn/)) in 2023.

My research interest includes **Low-level Vision**, **Multi-modal image/video generation**,**Inverse Problems**.

<span style="color:Orange;">I am actively seeking for research internship opportunities in either academia or industry, please feel free to contact me via email.

<!-- <span style="color:PaleVioletRed;">**I am currently looking for a PhD advisor for the fall of 2026**. -->

Hera is my Curriculum Vitae.[(CV)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/rgaeha27pgjsbnwycw88o/.pdf?rlkey=m9qrpzms57ibl0msgo5e5dn4z&st=hi5ka6kd&dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/rgaeha27pgjsbnwycw88o/.pdf?rlkey=m9qrpzms57ibl0msgo5e5dn4z&st=hi5ka6kd&dl=0)
