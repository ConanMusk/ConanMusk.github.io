<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year master's student at the School of Electronic Science, National University of Defense Technology ([NUDT](http://yjszs.nudt.edu.cn/index/index.view)), under the supervision of [Prof. Jingyuan Xia](https://www.xiajingyuan.com/). Previously, I obtained my B.Eng in Communication Engineering from the School of Communication and Information Engineering at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications([NJUPT](https://scie.njupt.edu.cn/)) in 2023.

My research interest includes **Low-level Vision**, **Multi-modal image/video generation**,**3DGS**.

<font color=Orange> I am actively seeking for research internship opportunities in either academia or industry, please feel free to contact me via email.</font>

<font color=YellowGreen>I am currently looking for a PhD advisor for the fall of 2026.</font>
